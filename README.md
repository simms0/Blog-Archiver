I follow certain bloggers of a, shall we say leftist political persuasion. Some of them operate in largely right wing communities. This leads to a certain amount of harassment; one of them, for example, is on his fifth tumblr in three years. As such I wanted a way to archive this material personally. Now some or all of these sites probably have APIs that would help me do this, but to begin with I will not be using them because 

Now this is questionably legal both in copying other people's material and in copying material that they themselves are using without permission, so if you're going to use this yourself be careful, don't break any laws.

What I want is web application which I can point at a tumblr (other blogging services to follow) and will capture its contents.

Features: 

Options on what to capture
  - posts
  - reposts
  - comments
  - media handling

Filtering by:
  - Tags
  - Text
  - regex
  - content
 
Putting tumblrs that people have with posts tiled across the screen back into a readable format

Future Features:
  - Veiw/preview of captured content
  - Pointing at non-tumblr blogging sites
  - Handling embedded media
  - collating blogs together
  - Poining at non-blog archives
